# Untitled Journal App

## Overview

This is an in-development journal app to allow users to:

- set their intentions
- complete daily tasks
- record and manage their health goals

It is designed to be a pure, opinionated day planner with a focus on
story-telling rather than task-setting.

## Why?

My partner wanted to try a digital journal, and I wanted to build a full-stack
app using TDD, Typescript and node.js. Two birds, and all that.

## Stack

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

### Frontend

- React
- Redux
- Sass
